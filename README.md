# Temperature_regulation_system
Project for Microprocessor Systems course at Poznan University of Technology
# Description
The system is able to regulate temperature in 26-60C range by ceramic resistor used for heating and cooling fan.
The desired (reference) value can be changed by the terminal sending message XX.XXC where XX.XX is our value in range.
The parameters of terminal are baudrate 115200, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
